An Angular application presenting a sample forum with posts and comments. The application connects to the API at link: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. The application supports the GET and POST method of the HTTP protocol, however, due to the inability to add new comments on the API's side, my application does not support adding new comments.

I created a website by using netlify company so it is avalible at link below:
